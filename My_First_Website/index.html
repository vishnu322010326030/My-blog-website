            <h1>Family and friends.</h1>
            <span></span>
            <p1>In my life, what matters most to me is my friends and family. Just think, “Where would I be if I had no friends and family.” These people are the most important human beings I know of on Earth. They always get me through rough times when I am down and they are always very understanding of what I am going through. They are my living diary and I can tell them almost anything that is on my mind or something that bothers me.
My family matters so much to me in my life. I always ask myself, “What would I do without them.” The truth is, I really don’t know what I would do without them. Life is already as difficult as climbing to the top of Mount Everest. To have my family every step of the way is so reassuring. I can talk to them about my problems and what I am having trouble with. They will try their best to help me and that is all that I ask for. Yeah, sometimes they can be annoying, but still I know they love me and all they are trying to do is help. My family matters to me because they give me a sense of love, joy, and laughter during rough times. I share a great bond with family and that is probably the most important aspect in life.</p1>

            <h1>School type</h1>
            <span></span>
            <p1>Education is an essential part of our lives. We are nothing without knowledge, and education is what separates us from others. The main step to acquiring education is enrolling oneself in a school. School serves as the first learning place for most of the people. Similarly, it is the first spark in receiving an education. In this essay on my school, I will tell you why I love my school and what my school has taught me.

We have all been to school and we have loved each and every moment we have spent over there as those were the building blocks of our lives. A school is a place where students are taught the fundamentals of life, as well as how to grow and survive in life. It instils in us values and principles that serve as the foundation for a child’s development.</p1>

            <h1>Career</h1>
            <span></span>
            <p1>It's important to 'zoom out' from your current experiences and look at your career in a bright perspective
                .I was talking to a technologist the other day, who was gravely worried about not having had a promotion in the last two years. “The hikes don’t even compare to what my friends got last year at startups. 
                ”</p1>
